##Cheat Tables

###Rainbow Six Vegas 2
***ANY GAMEPLAY CHEATS WITHIN CHEAT TABLE ARE NOT INTENDED FOR ONLINE USE OR TESTED ONLINE***
***ALL GAMEPLAY CHEATS WERE CREATED TO FACILITATE EASIER TESTING AND RESEARCH AS REQUIRED***
***I DO NOT CONDONE ANY USE OF THIS CHEAT TABLE TO RUIN ANYONE ELSE'S ONLINE EXPERIENCE OF THIS GAME***
Created for researching Field of View and Third Person Camera Modification along with other camera related research.
Field of View Modification within file is what I would consider *final*.
Camera Positioning information within is being used for both Third Person View *and* possible fly camera scripting.
